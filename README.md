# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNNs

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The goal is to accurately classify these images into their respective categories using a deep learning approach.

### Problem Statement

The CIFAR-10 dataset, standing for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research, is a widely recognized benchmark in machine learning and computer vision applications. Due to its diversity in categories and low-resolution images (32x32), it presents a unique challenge for image classification models.

### Data Source

The dataset can be found at [CIFAR-10 - Canadian Institute for Advanced Research](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Seaborn: For making statistical graphics.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
